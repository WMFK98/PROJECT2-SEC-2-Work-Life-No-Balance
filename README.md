## PIG-GAME Item

### How to Play

This game is designed for 2 players only. Each player rolls dice üé≤ each turn to accumulate points until reaching a target score between 50 and 500 (as set by the players ‚öôÔ∏è). To win, players must accumulate the required points. On their turn, players can choose to keep the points they roll or pass the turn to the other player. If a player rolls a 1, their turn automatically ends, and the other player takes their turn.

The game includes various ü™Ñ items that can assist players. To use an item, players must roll matching dice faces. Items can only be used in the next turn and multiple items can be used simultaneously.

### Items

Items can only be used if there is at least 1 die üé≤ in the game. Items cannot be used when all dice total 5. Players can cancel the use of ‚ùå items by clicking on them again if they are active, indicated by a yellow color üü°. Once a player rolls, the use of ‚úÖ items cannot be canceled. The game features 8 types of items:

#### x2>3

When this item is used, it doubles the points of the dice roll. However, every die must show a face with a score greater than 4. This item can be used once (items one use) but can be combined in the same round to double the points further.

#### Dice+

When this item is used, it adds an additional die each time you roll. The effect lasts until the end of the current turn (items per turn) and can stack up to a maximum of 5 dice.

#### 6

This item guarantees that one of the dice will show a 6. It can be used until the end of the current turn (items per turn) and can be combined to ensure future dice rolls also show 6.

#### -10

Using this item subtracts 10 points from the opponent's score when rolling the dice (items attack). It can be used multiple times in a round to reduce the opponent's score by 10 points for each use.

#### O&E

When the dice total an even number, this item steals points from the opponent (items attack). If the total is odd, half of the rolled points (rounded down) are given to the opponent. This item is effective until the end of the turn and can be used to double the results of all actions.

#### Dice-

When this item is used, it reduces the number of dice you have by 1 each time you roll (items attack). It can be used multiple times in a round until only 1 die remains.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/realFK98/PROJECT1-SEC-2-Work-Life-No-Balance/blob/main/progressLog/gif/-dice.gif"></p>

#### +2

Using this item adds 2 points to each die roll, provided that every die shows an even number. This item can be used once (items one use) and can be combined in the same round to double the additional points.
